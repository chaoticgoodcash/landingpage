        h3 I believe people are good. 
        p My folks always wished they could find a bag of money on the side of the road to solve all their problems. It's too late for them, but maybe I can help the next person. 
        p Every week I empty the ChaoticGood accounts into cash. I then leave the bag of cash somewhere. I'll leave clues on social accts. 
        p Find it. Keep it. Share it.
