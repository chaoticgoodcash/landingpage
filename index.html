    <h3>I believe people are good. </h3>
    <p>My folks always wished they could find a bag of money on the side of the road to solve all their problems. It's too late for them, but maybe I can help the next person. </p>
    <p>Every week I empty the ChaoticGood accounts into cash. I then leave the bag of cash somewhere. I'll leave clues on social accts. </p>
    <p>Find it. Keep it. Share it. </p>
