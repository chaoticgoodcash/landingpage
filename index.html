    <h3>I believe people are good. </h3>
    <p>My folks always wished they could find a bag of money on the side of the road to solve all their problems. It's too late for them, but maybe I can help the next person. </p>
    <p>Every week I empty the ChaoticGood accounts into cash. I then leave the bag of cash somewhere. I'll leave clues on social accts. </p>
    <p>If you find it, keep it, share it. </p>
    <ul> 
      <li>TikTok </li>
      <li>Twitter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can help it grow by adding to the accounts. </p>
    <ul> 
      <li>Venmo</li>
      <li>Paypal </li>
